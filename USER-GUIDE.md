## 🚀 Getting Started

### What is an Escrow Service?

An escrow service acts as a trusted third party that holds funds during a transaction between a buyer and seller. The funds are only released to the seller when the buyer confirms they're satisfied with the goods or services received.

###  Benefits:

- **Security**: Your money is protected until you receive what you paid for
- **Trust**: Both parties are protected from fraud
- **Transparency**: Track every step of your transaction
- **Dispute Resolution**: Professional mediation if issues arise
